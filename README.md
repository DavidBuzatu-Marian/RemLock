# RemLock
This project is a hackathon project for Oxford Hack 2020. It is an android application for making events and reminders to your calendar using the **screenshot button**. When the screenshot is triggered, the application uses Optical Character Recognition to extract the text from the image in a string form. The string is then parsed to autopopulate the details for creating an event in the Calendar app.
